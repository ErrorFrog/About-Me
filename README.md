# 🐸 Error Frog

**`Digital Craftsman`**


Hello, World! I’m a beginner full-stack developer and future computer science and cybersecurity major, building my own virtual world one line at a time. I’m starting at a young age, working to ensure safety and contribute to a better online world. Through dedication and effort, I hope to grow and show my progress over the years. My projects start from the ground up and represent my journey — from planning, to learning, to solving.
